1.  **Navigate to the Workbench:** Click on the "Workbench" button in the main navigation.
2.  **Upload a Document:** Find the "Upload" button (usually in the top-right corner). You can upload a PDF of a research paper, technical manual, or any document you wish to analyze.
3.  **Open the Document:** Once uploaded, your document will appear in your "Recent" list. Simply click on it to open it in the odoc.ai reader.

## Step 2: Start a Conversation with AI

Now that your document is open, it's time to experience the magic of interactive reading.

1.  **Select Text:** Use your mouse to highlight a sentence, a paragraph, or even just a single complex term that you want to understand better.
2.  **Open the AI Panel:** Upon selection, a small AI toolbar will appear. Click on the "Ask AI" or "Explain" button. This will open the AI chat panel on the side.
3.  **Ask a Question:** The AI panel is now ready for your input. You can start with simple commands or ask complex questions:
    *   `"Summarize this paragraph."`
    *   `"Explain this concept in simpler terms."`
    *   `"What are the key assumptions the author is making here?"`
    *   `"Translate this section to [your language]."`

You'll see the AI provide a detailed, context-aware answer in real-time. Feel free to continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions.
