### 6.4.4. Terminology Database
A personal terminology database allows you to customize translation results. When reading documents, the system will prioritize using your self-built or imported terminology database for matching. When specialized vocabulary, abbreviations, or institutional names already in the database appear in the original text, the translation will automatically be replaced with the specified translation from the database, ensuring consistent key concepts. If the default translation results do not match your disciplinary habits, you can modify them in the sidebar with one click and they will take effect immediately, applying to all subsequent documents without repeated correction.
Within the terminology database, you can search for terms, and select multiple terms for deletion. When editing a term, you can choose whether to distinguish between uppercase and lowercase, and whether to translate the term.
